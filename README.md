# Courier

**Courier** is a Phoenix-based server that connects people in shared rooms to exchange files using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology powered by WebRTC.

## How it works

1. Start the server
2. Enter a room name and password
3. Connect with another peer
4. Exchange files directly, peer-to-peer

Fast, simple, and serverless file sharing â€” just you and your peers.

## Launch

To start your Phoenix server:

- Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
